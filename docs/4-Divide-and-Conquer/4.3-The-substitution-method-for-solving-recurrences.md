# 4.3 The substitution method for solving recurrences
## 4.3-1
The substitution method requires us to prove that $T(n) \leq cn^2$ for an appropriate choice of the constant c > 0. We start by assuming that this bound holds for all positive m < n, in particular for m = n - 1, yielding $T(n - 1) \leq c(n - 1)^2$. Substituting ino the recurrence yields:

$$T(n) = T(n - 1) + n \leq c(n - 1)^2 + n = cn^2 + (1 - 2c)n + c$$

When $c \geq 1$, $cn^2 + (1 - 2c)n + c \leq cn^2 - n + c \leq cn^2 \text{ for all } n \geq c$, so $T(n) \leq cn^2$ holds as long as $c \geq 1 \text { and } n \geq c$.

Now we need to show that the boundary conditions are suitable as base cases for the inductive proof. From the previous proof, we can see that we should pick $n_0$ as base case when $n_0 = c$. So we can simply pick c = 1, thus the inductive proof holds for n = 1. Or you can pick c = 2, then the base becomes n = 2. Nomatter what c is, we can always find a base case.

## 4.3-2
We start by assuming that $T(n) \leq c\lg{n}$ holds for all positive m < n, in particular for $m = \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$, yielding $T(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil) \leq c\lg{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil}$. Substituting ino the recurrence yields:

$$T(n) = T(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil) + 1 \leq c\lg{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil} + 1 \leq c(\lg{(\frac{n + (2 - 1)}{2})}) + 1 \text{ (inequation 3.6) } = c\lg{(n + 1)} - c + 1$$

But it's not easy to prove that $c\lg{(n + 1)} - c + 1 \leq c\lg{n}$, so we reguess $T(n) = O(\lg{(n - 1)})$, since if $T(n) = O(\lg{(n - 1)})$, then it's obviously $O(\lg{n})$. Substituting ino the recurrence yields:

$$T(n) \leq c\lg{(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil -1)} + 1 \leq c\lg{(\frac{n + (2 - 1)}{2} -1)} + 1 = c\lg{(n - 1)} - c + 1 \leq c\lg{(n - 1)} < c\lg{n}$$

where the last step holds as long as $c \geq 1$.

Similarly like recurrence 4.19, the inductinve proof fails for the base case T(1), since $c\lg{1} = 0$. So we can choose n = 2 as the base case. Let's assume T(1) = a, so we have T(2) = a + 1, T(3) = a + 2, T(4) = a + 2, T(5) = a + 2, ... , we can know that $T(n) = a + \lfloor \lg{n} \rfloor$. So we can choose $c \geq max(2a, 2)$, which suffices for the bases of n = 2.

## 4.3-3
We start by assuming that $T(n) \geq cn\lg{n}$ holds for all positive m < n, in particular for $m = \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$, yielding $T(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor) \geq c\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\lg{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}$. Substituting ino the recurrence yields:

$$T(n) = 2T(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor) + n \geq 2c\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\lg{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor} + n \geq cn\lg(\frac{n}{2}) + n = cn\lg{n} + (1 - c)n \geq cn\lg{n}$$

where the last step holds as long as $c \leq 1$.

Similarly, we cannot choose n = 1 as the base case. we know T(2) = 4, and T(3) = 5, so we can choose a c such that $T(2) \geq c2\lg{2}$ and $T(3) \geq c3\lg{3}$. We can simply choose c = 1, which suffices the base cases.

Since $T(n) = O(n\lg{n})$ and $T(n) = \Omega(n\lg{n})$, so $T(n) = \Theta(n\lg{n})$.

## 4.3-4
We can choose $T(n) = O(n\lg{n} + 1)$, then $T(n) \leq cn\lg{n} + 1$. It holds for the base case, since $c1\lg{1} + 1 = 1 \geq T(1)$.

## 4.3-5
First, let's prove $T(n) = O(n\lg{n})$. We start by assuming that $T(n) \leq cn\lg{n}$ holds for all positive m < n, yielding $T(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil) \leq c\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\lg{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil}$ and $T(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor) \leq c\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\lg{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}$. Substituting ino the recurrence yields:

$$T(n) = T(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil) + T(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor) + \Theta(n) \leq c\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\lg{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil} + c\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\lg{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor} + \Theta(n)$$
