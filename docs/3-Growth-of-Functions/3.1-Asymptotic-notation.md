# 3.1 Asymptotic notation
## 3.1-1
According to the basic definition of $\Theta$-notation, if $max(f(n), g(n)) = \Theta(f(n) + g(n))$, then there exist positive constants $c_1$, $c_2$ and $n_0$ such that:

$$0 \leq c_1(f(n) + g(n)) \leq max(f(n), g(n)) \leq c_2(f(n) + g(n)),\ for \ all \ n \geq n_0$$

Because f(n) and g(n) are nongenative, so it's obvious that $max(f(n), g(n)) \leq f(n) + g(n)$, so we can let $c_2$ be 1.

And we also know that $max(f(n), g(n)) \geq f(n)$ and $max(f(n), g(n)) \geq g(n)$, so $2max(f(n), g(n)) \geq f(n) + g(n)$, thus $max(f(n), g(n)) \geq \frac{f(n) + g(n)}{2}$. So we can let $c_1$ be $\frac{1}{2}$.

Because $0 \leq \frac{f(n) + g(n)}{2} \leq max(f(n), g(n)) \leq f(n) + g(n)$ is true for all n, so we can let $n_0$ be 1.

So we've found positive constants $c_1$, $c_2$ and $n_0$, thus $max(f(n), g(n)) = \Theta(f(n) + g(n))$.

## 3.1-2
According to [Newton's generalised binomial theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem), we have:

$$(n + a)^b = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \binom{b}{k}n^{b - k}a^k = n^b + bn^{b - 1}a + \frac{b(b - 1)}{2!}n^{b - 2}a^2 + \dots$$

Since $n^b$ grows faster than others, so $(n + a)^b = \Theta(n^b)$.

## 3.1-3
The O-notation denotes a upper bound, so we can only say "The running time of algorithm A is at most $O(n^2)$".

## 3.1-4
$2^{n + 1} = O(2^n)$, because there exist positive constants c = 2 and $n_0 = 1$ such that $0 \leq 2^{n + 1} \leq 2 * 2^n\ for\ all\ n \geq n_0$.

$2^{2n} \neq O(2^n)$. Suppose $2^{2n} = O(2^n)$, then there exist positive constants c and $n_0$ such that $0 \leq 2^{2n} \leq c2^n\ for\ all\ n \geq n_0$, which means $0 \leq 2^n \leq c\ for\ all\ n \geq n_0$. No matter how big c is, $2^n$ will be bigger than c after a specific $n_1$, so you cannot find a $n_0$ like that.
