# 3.2 Standard notations and common functions
## 3.2-1
If f(n) and g(n) are monotonically increasing functions, then if $m \leq n$, we have $f(m) \leq f(n)$ and $g(m) \leq g(n)$. So we get $f(m) + g(m) \leq f(n) + g(n)$ when $m \leq n$. So the function f(n) + g(n) is monotonically increasing.

Let $m_1 = g(m)$ and $n_1 = g(n)$. Because $m_1 \leq n_1$, so $f(m_1) \leq f(n_1)$, so f(g(n)) is monotonically increasing.

if f(n) and g(n) are nonnegative, because $f(m) \leq f(n)$ and $g(m) \leq g(n)$, so we can multiply the inequations and have $f(m) \cdot g(m) \leq f(n) \cdot g(n)$. Thus $f(n) \cdot g(n)$ is monotonically increasing.
