# 5.3 Randomized algorithms
## 5.3-1
We can randomly swap the first element first, then start the for loop from the second element.

```
RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE(A)
n = A.length
swap A[1] with A[RANDOM(1, n)]
for i = 2 to n
    swap A[i] with A[RANDOM(i, n)]
```

And here is the initialization step: before the first loop iteration, i = 2. The loop invariant says that for each possible 1-permutation, the subarray A[1..1] contains this 1-permutation with probability (n - i + 1)!/n! = (n - 1)!/n! = 1/n. The subarray A[1..1] contains only one element, contains 1-permutation with probability 1/n, so the loop invariant holds prior to the first iteration.

The maintenance and termination steps remain the same.

## 5.3-2
No, it cannot get any permutation, for example, the identity permutation.
