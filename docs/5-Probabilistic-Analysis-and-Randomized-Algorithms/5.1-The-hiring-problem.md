# 5.1 The hiring problem
## 5.1-1
Because we are always able to determine which candidate is best, that means we can compare any two candidates and know which is better. Thus we are able to sort the candidates based on this knowledge, which implies that we know a total order on the ranks of the candidates.

## 5.1-2
First we find the smallest number `p`, such that `2^p > b - a`. Then call `RANDOM(0, 1)` to generate `p` bits, thus we have a random number `r`. If `r + a <= b`, then that's what we want, otherwise we regenerate `r`.

```py
import math
import random


def random_number(a, b):
    bits = math.ceil(math.log2(b - a + 1))

    while True:
        number = random_binay(bits)

        if a + number <= b:
            return a + number


def random_binay(bits):
    number = 0

    for i in range(bits):
        number = number * 2 + random.randint(0, 1)

    return number
```
