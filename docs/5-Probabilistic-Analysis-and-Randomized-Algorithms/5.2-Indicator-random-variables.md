# 5.2 Indicator random variables
## 5.2-1
We hire exactly one time when the first candidate is the best. So the first candidate has a probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ of being better qualified than other n - 1 candidates. Thus the probability of hiring exactly one time is $\frac{1}{n}$.

We hire n times when each candidate is better than the previous candidate. In each turn, the candidate i has a probability of $\frac{1}{i}$ of being better than the previous i - 1 candidates. Thus the probability is $1 * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{3} * \ldots * \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{n!}$.

We hire exactly twice when the first candidate is not the best candidate, and the best candidate comes before all the candidates who are better than the first candidate.

Let's assume the first candidate has a rank k among the candidates (k < n, bigger is better). So there are n - k candidates that are better than the first candidate, including the best candidate. So the best candidate could only appear through position 2 to k + 1, which are k + 1 - 2 + 1 = k positions. And the best candidate has a probability of $\frac{1}{k}$ to apppear in those k positions.

Because each candidate has a probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ to appear in the first position, thus the probability of hiring twice is $\frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{3} \ldots \frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{n - 1} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1}\frac{1}{k} = \frac{\ln{(n - 1)} + O(1)}{n}$.
